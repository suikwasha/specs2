 Mockito is a Java library for mocking.

 The following samples are taken from the main documentation which can be found here:
 http://mockito.googlecode.com/svn/tags/latest/javadoc/org/mockito/Mockito.html
                                                                                                                       
 CREATION
 ========

 Mocks can be created
   + with a name
   + with a default return value
   + with a name and default return value
   + with a default answer
   + with settings

 VERIFICATION
 ============

 When a mock is created with the mock method
   + it is possible to call methods on the mock
   + it is possible to verify that a method has been called
   + if one method has not been called on a mock there will be a failure
   + it is possible to check that no calls have been made
   + null values can be checked with beNull
   + it is possible to pass byname parameters
     + with several byname parameters
     + with 2 parameter lists and byname parameters
   + it is possible to check byname parameters
     + with several byname parameters
     + with mixed byname parameter and byvalue parameter
     + with 2 parameter lists and byname parameters
   it is possible to check a function parameter
     + with one argument
     + with one argument and a matcher for the return value
     + with n arguments
     + with n arguments and a matcher for the return value
     + as being anything
     + with Nothing as the return type
     + with Any as the return type

   it is possible to check a partial function parameter
     + with n arguments
     + with n arguments and a matcher for the return value
     + as being anything
     + when the argument is not defined

   it is possible to verify a function with implicit conversions
     + with a single converted parameter
     + with a single converted parameter, using a matcher

   + it is possible to verify a function with repeated parameters
   + it is possible to specify a timeout for the call

STUBS
=====

 It is also possible to return a specific value from a mocked method
   + then when the mocked method is called, the same values will be returned
   + different successive values can even be returned
   a value can be returned when a parameter of the method matches
     + a hamcrest matcher
     + a specs2 matcher
     + with a subtype matcher
     + a Set
     + a List
   a value can be returned when a return type was
     + an AnyVal


 It is also possible to throw an exception from a mocked method
   + then when the mocked method is called, the exception will be thrown
   + different successive exceptions can even be thrown

 + A mock can be created and stubbed at the same time

 NUMBER OF CALLS
 ===============

 The number of calls to a mocked method can be checked
   + if the mocked method has been called once
   + if the mocked method has been called twice
   + if the mocked method has been called atLeast n times
   + if the mocked method has been called atMost n times
   + if the mocked method has never been called
   + if the verification throws an exception, it will be reported as an Error
   + if the mocked method has not been called after some calls
   + if the mocked method has not been called after some calls - ignoring stubs

 ORDER OF CALLS
 ==============

 The order of calls to a mocked method can be checked
   + with 2 calls that were indeed in order
   + with 2 calls that were indeed in order - ignoring stubbed methods
   + with 2 calls that were indeed not in order
   + with 3 calls that were indeed not in order

 ANSWERS & PARAMETERS CAPTURE
 ============================

 + Answers can be created to control the returned a value
 + Answers can use the mock instance as the second parameter
 + Answers can use the mock instance, even when the method has 0 parameters

 + A parameter can be captured in order to check its value
 + A parameter can be captured in order to check its successive values

 The Mockito trait is reusable in other contexts
   + in mutable specs
   + with an in order call
                                                                                                                        """
