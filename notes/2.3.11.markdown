Maintenance version

## Improvements

 * added await on `Future[T : AsResult]` to directly return a result [#241](http://github.com/etorreborre/specs2/issues/241)
 * added a `NoStdOutAroundExample` trait to remove any console output during an example execution

## Deprecations

 * `matcher.toSet`, `matcher.toSeq`, `matcher.forall`... are now deprecated since they can be expressed more clearly by using collection matchers

## Fixes

 * fixed `contain` matchers when using them with `not`
 * documented the use of argThat [#240](http://github.com/etorreborre/specs2/issues/240)
